# Text-Classification-Using-Naive-Bayes--My-implementation
Have implemented my own Text Classifier using Multinomial Naive Bayes. Comparisons are also made with the Scikit learn's version of MultinomialNB.

Aim was to make this classifier from scratch without using NLTK or any other great libraries already present.
  -Have made my custom list of stopwords that are removed from the data.
  - Made vocabulary using words that appear significant number of times only.
  - Around 20,000 text documents are used.
  
  
Open the Jupyter Notebook and it has sklearn's results in the first half and then my result in second half.

Datasets used are attached in the folder.
